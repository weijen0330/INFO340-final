# [Track your drone](medical-drone.herokuapp.com)
This is Team 6's final project for INFO 340. My teammates and I used the project to model a really great company call [Zipline](http://flyzipline.com/product/), which utilizes small drones to deliver medical supplies in Rwanda. Their drone-based delivery system removes poor infrastructure out of the equation and ensures efficient and timely delivery.

## Technology used:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap
Back-end: Go([Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin))
DBMS: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Current Trips (View)
A table displaying the drone trips that are currently in transit from the past 10 days.

### Search Trips (Update)
The search bar allows you to search for a current drone trip using the name of the destination.
A destination can be a health clinic or a village.

### Request for Cargo (Insert)
This is a function mainly for doctors to request for medical materials.
